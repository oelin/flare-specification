# Flare Specification 1.0.0

## 1. Playlists

### 1.1. Syntax

A Flare playlist MUST be a *valid*, UTF-8 encoded YAML file with the following structure:

```yaml
<Stream 0 Name>:
    headers:
        ...
    content:
        - <Chunk 0 URL>
        - <Chunk 1 URL>
        - ...

<Stream 1 Name>:
    headers:
        ...
    content:
        - <Chunk 0 URL>
        - <Chunk 1 URL>
        - ...
```

where:

* Stream names MUST be unique.
* Chunk URLs SHOULD be unique.
* Chunk URLs SHOULD conform to [RFC-1738](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1738).
* Chunk URLs MUST use the HTTP(s) scheme.


### 1.2. Semantics

Each chunk MUST be independent such that it can be downloaded without reference to any other chunk (in any stream).

Stream headers are arbitrary objects. Their semantics SHOULD be decided by the client.
